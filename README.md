- [Time Series] Alter "iNZightTS" so that it can handle datasets with the "DATE" columns in column 2+.

Directories:
------------
- data:
This directory holds all the data. The data must be placed in sub-directories, which will come up as data categories within iNZight-Lite.

- gui-elements:
This directory contains the gui functions for all the old modules (from iNZight revamp). 

- www:
This directory is used for graphics and/or web-related files such as .css and .gif/.jpeg/.png. Images are stored in a sub-directory called "images".

- panels:
This directory contains the gui, server, help, and other functions for each module. It currently contains the "About", "Time Series", "Visualize", and "Help" modules. This makes it easier to modify code.

Main files:
-----------
- README:
Documentation for iNZight *Lite*. Update as required.

- global.R:
Defines functions and variables that are used globally. For now, all non-GUI functions are stored here.

- server.R:
Script for shiny server.

- ui.R:
Defines the main GUI.
